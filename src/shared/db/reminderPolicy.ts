/**
 * Golden-hour reminder planning (REQ-10 / SETE-89).
 *
 * Reminders mirror each card's SRS due time (`review_schedule.next_review_at`,
 * the Stage-1 schema field) as local notifications. Because the OS owns the
 * pending-notification state, the planner here is a pure reconciliation between
 * what the DB says should be pending and what the OS actually has pending:
 *
 *  - a pending notification whose card is no longer due in the future, or whose
 *    due time has changed, is cancelled (stale / reschedule),
 *  - a due-in-the-future card with no matching pending notification is
 *    scheduled (this also covers the first schedule after a review moved the
 *    card's due time forward).
 *
 * The notification delivery itself is an injected port (native), so this file
 * stays deterministic and unit-testable.
