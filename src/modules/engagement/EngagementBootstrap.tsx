 * system feature is enabled. Delivers no UI — gamification state is always
 * recomputed from the persisted event log on read (see `getGamificationSnapshot`).
 *
 * Notifications are installed by `bootstrapGoldenHourReminders`: when the OS
 * already granted permission it swaps the no-op scheduler for the real native
 * adapter and reconciles; otherwise the no-op scheduler keeps this path safe.
