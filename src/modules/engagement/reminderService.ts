/**
 * Golden-hour reminders (REQ-10 / SETE-89).
 *
 * Reminders are local notifications scheduled at each card's SRS due time
 * (`review_schedule.next_review_at`, the Stage-1 `dueAt` field). The OS owns
 * the pending-notification state, so the service reconciles the DB's desired
 * reminders against what the OS actually has pending: stale notifications for
 * cards that were reviewed (no longer due in the future) or whose due time
 * changed are cancelled, and cards that became due in the future are scheduled.
 * Reconcile runs on every app start and after review sessions, so force-quit
 * and relaunch keeps reminders consistent with the schedule.
 *
 * Delivery itself is an injected port because scheduling real notifications is
 * native work (iOS/Android notification APIs). See `noopReminderScheduler`;
 * wiring a real adapter (e.g. a local-notification library) is the device
 * integration slice, mirroring how chapter-audio downloads inject their native
 * file store.
