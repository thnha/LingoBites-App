/**
 * One completed review session as seen by the engagement layer (REQ-11, ADR-4).

 * A "session" is the run of due cards the learner rates in one visit to the
 * daily review screen. The screen records each rated card into the session and
 * calls `finish()` when the session ends (the whole batch is done, or the
 * learner leaves after rating at least one card). Finishing appends the
 * gamification events — a `review_session_completed` event carrying the XP the
 * session earned, plus a `review_on_time` event per card reviewed on or before
 * its due day. No event is written unless at least one card was actually rated,
 * so gamification can never credit a review that did not happen.
