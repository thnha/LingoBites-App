 * Public entry point for downloaded-audio reads. Screens call this instead

 * the repository stays synchronous under the hood, this only relocates
 * which layer is allowed to know about it.
 *
 * Each member forwards to the repository by name at call time (not captured
 * once into an object) so `jest.spyOn(AudioAssetRepository, ...)` in
 * existing tests keeps working through this indirection.
