# LingoBites Mobile App

LingoBites is a mobile application concept designed for Vietnamese speakers who are new to English, helping them learn from real-world English content. The app turns everyday English text (captured via camera, imported from gallery, or pasted) into interactive, structured lessons in Vietnamese.

This repository contains the mobile client application built using **React Native CLI** and **TypeScript**.

The backend API proxy is located in the separate `LingoBites-Server` repository.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have completed the [React Native Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide for React Native CLI.

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> LingoBites-App
cd LingoBites-App

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# For iOS, install CocoaPods
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to create your local environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.development
```

Edit `.env.development` and set:
- `API_BASE_URL`: The URL of your local or staging backend API proxy (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or the Cloud Run URL).
- `USE_MOCK_AI`: Set to `true` to use mock AI fixtures (no backend API request) or `false` to connect to the actual backend API.
- `USE_MOCK_OCR`: Set to `true` to mock OCR extraction.

### Step 3: Run the Application

First, start Metro (the JavaScript bundler):

```sh
npm start
```

In a new terminal window/pane, build and run the app:

#### iOS
```sh
npm run ios
```

#### Android
```sh
npm run android
```
