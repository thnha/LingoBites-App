# Implementation Notes: Environment Setup

## Task Summary
Wire Phase 0 local, staging, and production environment configuration across mobile and API while keeping real env values out of commits.

## Assumptions
- The user-provided environment setup plan is the task-specific scope for native iOS/Android environment wiring even though it exceeds the M2 milestone allowlist.
- Existing unrelated modified files are user changes and must be preserved.
- Local env files may be created for verification but must not be staged or committed.

## Decisions
- Work in the current checkout because the user explicitly requested executing the plan at this path.
- Preserve the existing `LingoBites-Server/.env` rather than overwriting it because it already existed locally and may contain developer-specific values.
- Android uses hoisted repo-root `node_modules`, so Gradle paths were made explicit rather than assuming app-local `node_modules`.
- iOS uses hoisted repo-root `node_modules`, so scheme pre-actions invoke `react-native-config` from `${SRCROOT}/../../../node_modules/...`.

## Changes from Spec
- The planned focused Jest command used `-v`, which this Jest version rejects. Verification used `npx jest src/shared/api/__tests__/appConfig.test.ts` instead.
- iOS target configs use wrapper xcconfig files that include CocoaPods generated configs first, then shared `Config.xcconfig`; this avoids CocoaPods base-configuration warnings while keeping one shared env-driven config.
- The verification script pins the known working Node 22 path when present because the shell default Node 26/x64 caused an esbuild architecture mismatch in this workspace.
- Review follow-up changed the generic mobile `ios`/`android` scripts to development variants and updated the legacy `ScanLearnEnglish` iOS scheme to regenerate development env settings.

## Tradeoffs / Risks
- `.env` was tracked and modified at baseline; review follow-up removed it from the git index while preserving the local file.
- iOS project file edits are high risk and require verification with Xcode tooling.
- Android release manifest processing triggers a JS/Hermes bundle task in this Gradle setup; verification depends on a correct hoisted Hermes compiler path.
- `bundle install` was needed locally for CocoaPods execution and installed gems under `vendor/bundle`, but the generated Bundler lockfile churn was removed because it was not part of the environment setup.

## Tests / Verification
- Baseline `git status --short` showed existing modified files: `.env`, `SavedLessonDetailScreen.test.tsx`, and `src/shared/api/types.ts`.
- `npx jest src/shared/api/__tests__/appConfig.test.ts -v` failed before running tests because `-v` is not recognized by this Jest CLI.
- `npx jest src/shared/api/__tests__/appConfig.test.ts` passed: 5 tests.
- `npm run mobile:test` initially failed due stale `3001` URL expectations in API client tests.
- `npm run mobile:test` passed after updating stale expected local API URLs: 28 suites, 86 tests.
- `npm run api:test -- --test-name-pattern loadEnv` first failed under sandbox because `tsx` could not create an IPC pipe.
- Escalated `npm run api:test -- --test-name-pattern loadEnv` failed as expected before implementation: missing `appEnv`.
- Escalated `npm run api:test` passed after implementation: 33 tests.
- `npm install --save-dev cross-env@^7.0.3` failed under sandbox with DNS `ENOTFOUND`.
- Escalated `npm install --save-dev cross-env@^7.0.3` succeeded with 0 vulnerabilities.
- Non-escalated `cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleStagingDebug --console=plain` failed because Gradle could not write `~/.gradle` wrapper lock under sandbox.
- Escalated `./gradlew :app:assembleStagingDebug --console=plain` initially failed on hoisted `node_modules` paths; after Gradle path fixes it passed: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6m 13s`.
- Escalated `./gradlew :app:processDevelopmentDebugMainManifest --console=plain` passed.
- Escalated `./gradlew :app:processStagingReleaseMainManifest --console=plain` initially failed on Hermes command path; after absolute hoisted Hermes path it passed.
- `rg usesCleartextTraffic android/app/build/intermediates/merged_manifest/developmentDebug` found `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`.
- `rg usesCleartextTraffic android/app/build/intermediates/merged_manifest/stagingRelease` found `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"`.
- Escalated `bundle install` in `this repo` installed CocoaPods gems locally; `arch -arm64 bundle exec pod install` passed after matching the platform architecture.
- `xcodebuild -workspace ios/ScanLearnEnglish.xcworkspace -scheme Staging -configuration DebugStag -showBuildSettings` passed and showed `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.yourcompany.lingobites.staging`, `APP_NAME = LingoBites Staging`, and `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIconStaging`.
- `ENVFILE=.env.production ... BuildXCConfig.rb` plus `xcodebuild -workspace ios/ScanLearnEnglish.xcworkspace -scheme Production -configuration ReleaseProd -showBuildSettings` passed and showed `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.yourcompany.lingobites`, `APP_NAME = LingoBites`, and `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon`.
- `xcodebuild -list -workspace ios/ScanLearnEnglish.xcworkspace` showed the `Development`, `Staging`, and `Production` schemes.
- Escalated `./scripts/verify-env-setup.sh` passed end to end:
  - mobile Jest: 28 suites, 86 tests
  - API Vitest: 33 tests
  - Android assemble: development debug, staging debug, production release
  - Android manifest checks: development cleartext true, staging release cleartext false
  - iOS staging build settings: staging bundle ID detected
  - env secret scan: no committed template/local env key names matched the blocked secret pattern
- Review follow-up verification added:
  - production mock-AI env guard in mobile config and verifier
  - legacy `ScanLearnEnglish` scheme development bundle ID check
  - `git rm --cached .env` to keep local env ignored and unstaged
- After review fixes, escalated `./scripts/verify-env-setup.sh` passed end to end:
  - mobile Jest: 29 suites, 97 tests
  - API Node tests: 33 tests
  - Android assemble: development debug, staging debug, production release
  - Android manifest checks: development cleartext true, staging release cleartext false
  - iOS build settings: staging bundle ID and legacy development bundle ID detected
  - env secret scan and production mock-AI scan passed

## Review Notes
- Pay close attention to native build configuration names and real env files accidentally entering git.
- `.env` should appear as deleted from the index for the next commit, while the local file remains on disk and ignored after commit.
