## Problem Statement

For Vietnamese adults who are nearly restarting from English basics but need English for Full-stack Developer work, generic translation or vocabulary-review apps do not create observable speaking ability in realistic software-work situations. The desired outcome is an offline-first mobile learning system that guides the learner from A0 toward functional A2/B1 communication through 15-20 minute blocks, profession-specific content, active recall, speaking practice, SRS, mastery tracking, and remediation.

## Context

The current LingoBites app already provides a React Native mobile foundation with local SQLite persistence, lesson history, vocabulary flashcards, fixed-interval review, review outbox sync, audio manifest/cache support, release flags, themed UI, and a Node/Fastify API for AI/OCR, review events, and per-chapter audio manifests.

The requested feature set is larger than the existing review MVP. It changes the product from "learn from captured English text" into a curated career-learning path for one target learner profile. This spec preserves reusable platform work while defining the new course/content runtime as an incremental extension, not a rewrite.

## Outcomes

| ID | Outcome | Priority/Status | Verification Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| OUT-1 | Learner can complete daily 15-20 minute study blocks that combine review, new content, listening, speaking, recall, and feedback. | Must / Confirmed | VC-1, VC-4 |
| OUT-2 | Learner progresses through a visible A0 to A2/B1 Full-stack English path with stages, units, prerequisites, and observable lesson outputs. | Must / Confirmed | VC-2, VC-3 |
| OUT-3 | Learner reviews phrases, sentence patterns, Q&A turns, dialogue turns, and personal errors through offline SRS. | Must / Confirmed | VC-5, VC-6 |
| OUT-4 | Learner can practice speaking through shadowing, recording, role-play, and self-check without misleading accent scoring claims. | Must / Confirmed | VC-7 |
| OUT-5 | The app adapts study blocks based on review backlog, weak skills, prerequisites, recent errors, and speaking gaps using explainable rules. | Must / Confirmed | VC-8 |
| OUT-6 | Content, audio, progress, SRS, recordings, and learner profile data continue to work offline after content is downloaded. | Must / Confirmed | VC-9, VC-10 |
| OUT-7 | MVP proves the learning loop with 15-20 complete lessons and 100-150 target chunks before expanding to the full 30-unit curriculum. | Must / Confirmed | VC-11 |
| OUT-8 | Progress reports show capability evidence instead of a single misleading score. | Should / Confirmed | VC-12 |

### Boundary Cases

| Item | Proposed Handling |
|---|---|
| Existing scan/paste/OCR lesson generator | Approved: hide from the English Full-stack MVP path and keep behind release flags as a legacy/future optional input. |
| Existing vocabulary-only flashcards | Reuse repository patterns, but extend the review domain to support multiple review item types. |
| Existing gamification | Keep optional and secondary. Do not optimize MVP success around streaks. |
| Existing review outbox sync | Can remain for telemetry/history, but MVP learning must not require network. |
| Native speech-to-text | Approved: include as optional support where available; never use it as the sole pass/fail mechanism. |

## Actors and Systems

| Actor/System | Role |
|---|---|
| Learner | Completes study blocks, speaks, records, reviews, and provides self-ratings. |
| Mobile app | Runs learning path, lesson runtime, SRS, mastery, recordings, content import, offline storage, progress reports. |
| Content package | Versioned lesson/activity/audio metadata and assets with stable IDs. |
| Node content service | Serves content manifests and package metadata; may point clients to CDN/object storage for assets. |
| Existing API service | Keeps AI/OCR/review-event/audio-manifest capabilities where useful, but is not required for offline lesson execution after package download. |
| OS audio/recording/STT services | Play audio, record learner voice, optionally transcribe when available. |

| CON-2 | Local-first/offline execution is mandatory after content download. | Product/Technical | Attachment / Confirmed | Lesson runtime, SRS, audio playback, recordings, and progress cannot require network. |
| CON-3 | MVP must be rule-based and must not depend on ML/AI for adaptation. | Product/Technical | Attachment / Confirmed | Adaptation rules must be deterministic and unit-testable. |
| CON-4 | MVP must not claim precise accent scoring. | Product/Legal/Trust | Attachment / Confirmed | Speaking evaluation copy and UI must avoid unsupported claims. |
| CON-5 | Content IDs must be stable across package versions. | Data | Attachment / Confirmed | Content authoring and import tooling need lint/contract checks. |
| CON-6 | Do not log raw vocabulary, learner text, full lesson text, recordings, or AI output in telemetry. | Privacy/Security | Current docs/code + MVP plan / Confirmed | Analytics and sync schemas must be privacy-safe. |
| CON-7 | Legacy docs under `mobile-app/docs/legacy` must not be modified for current MVP work. | Operational | Current docs README / Confirmed | New final spec belongs in current docs tree. |
| CON-8 | MVP target content is 15-20 complete lessons, not the full 30-unit roadmap. | Scope | Attachment / Confirmed | Planning must prioritize vertical-slice quality over breadth. |

## Selected Direction

Status: Approved by owner comment "chốt theo khuyến nghị"; implementation planning is explicitly deferred.

Direction: Extend the current React Native local-first app into a curated offline course runtime. Keep existing flashcard/review/storage/audio/release infrastructure where it fits, add a versioned content package domain, generalize review items beyond vocabulary, build a deterministic lesson runtime and adaptation engine, and use the Node service for content manifests/assets rather than making runtime AI central to MVP.

Rationale:

- The current app already has reusable foundations: SQLite, fixed-interval review, flashcard UI, audio manifest/cache, outbox sync, feature flags, and themed mobile UI.
- The user-provided draft explicitly says MVP should be rule-based and not depend on AI.
- A curated vertical slice is easier to verify with an A0 learner than a broad generated-content system.
- Content versioning and stable IDs are necessary before large-scale lesson authoring, otherwise progress/SRS data will become fragile.

Accepted trade-offs:

- Existing capture/OCR/AI functionality becomes secondary for this product direction.
- Review storage must be generalized, which is more work than only adding screens.
- Content authoring quality becomes a critical dependency.
- Some current gamification/review UI may need reshaping to support speaking-first learning outcomes.

Implementation discretion:

- Exact SQLite table names and TypeScript type names may differ if they preserve the domain boundaries and verification criteria.
- The approved content package format is hybrid ZIP: `manifest.json` + lesson JSON + audio/assets + checksums.
- Audio codec/bitrate may be selected during implementation based on React Native playback compatibility, as long as files remain lightweight and checksum-verified.
- OS speech-to-text is an optional enhancement only, not a required scoring path.

## Solution Options and Trade-Offs

| Criterion | OPT-1: Extend Current App Incrementally | OPT-2: Build Separate Course App | OPT-3: AI-Generated Adaptive Course |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reuse current implementation | Strong | Weak | Moderate |
| Offline reliability | Strong | Strong | Weak unless generation is precomputed |
| Content quality control | Strong | Strong | Weak/Unknown |
| Time to MVP | Moderate | Weak | Moderate initially, risky later |
| Fit to confirmed requirement "rule-based, not AI-dependent" | Strong | Strong | Weak |
| Migration complexity | Moderate | Weak | Moderate |
| Long-term maintainability | Strong if content domain is clean | Moderate | Unknown |

Recommendation: OPT-1. Use the existing app as the platform foundation and implement the course runtime as a new current-MVP product layer. OPT-2 is only preferable if the existing codebase blocks clean content/runtime boundaries. OPT-3 conflicts with the MVP principle and should be deferred until the deterministic learning loop proves retention.

## Functional Architecture

```text
React Native App
  ├─ Onboarding & Career Profile
  ├─ Learning Map
  ├─ Today Study Center
  ├─ Lesson Runtime
  ├─ Speaking Room
  ├─ Review/SRS Engine
  ├─ Mastery & Error Notebook
  ├─ Adaptation Rule Engine
  ├─ Progress & Assessment
  ├─ Content Package Manager
  ├─ Audio & Recording Service
  └─ Local Data Layer (SQLite + files)

Node Content/API Service
  ├─ Content Manifest API
  ├─ Package Version Metadata
  ├─ Audio/Asset Manifest Support
  ├─ Review Event Ingestion (optional sync)
  └─ Existing OCR/AI endpoints behind flags
```

Module boundaries:

- Lesson Runtime must render declared activities and record attempts; it must not compute long-term scheduling directly.
- Review/SRS Engine must schedule review items; it must not choose the visible study block UI.
- Adaptation Rule Engine must select and explain the next block; it must not mutate content definitions.
- Content Package Manager must import immutable content versions; it must not rewrite learner progress.
- Audio & Recording Service must manage files and permissions; it must not evaluate mastery alone.

## Data Model

### New or Generalized Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `content_packages` | Installed hybrid ZIP package version, checksum status, install status, active flag | Separates content version from binary version. |
| `levels`, `stages`, `units`, `lessons`, `activities` | Course structure | May live in package JSON/SQLite plus local index tables. |
| `content_items` | Shared stable item registry for vocabulary, chunks, patterns, Q&A, dialogue turns | Enables SRS beyond vocabulary. |
| `lesson_prerequisites`, `item_prerequisites` | Unlock and remediation graph | Must be linted for cycles. |
| `learner_profile`, `career_profile`, `project_portfolio` | Personalization inputs | Local-first; user editable. |
| `lesson_attempts`, `activity_attempts` | Attempt and evidence history | Records hints, response time, result, mode, timestamps. |
| `review_items`, `review_events`, `mastery_state` | Generalized SRS and mastery | Evolves current flashcards/review tables. |
| `error_events`, `error_categories`, `remediation_rules` | Error notebook and recovery path | Links failures to specific causes and next practice. |
| `recordings` | Local metadata for recorded learner audio | File path, activity/attempt link, duration, created time. |

### Existing Reusable Structures

- Current `lessons` can remain for captured/generated lessons, but curated course lessons should use stable content IDs.
- Current `flashcards` can inspire UI and repository patterns, but SRS must not stay vocabulary-only.
- Current `review_schedule` and `review_sessions` implement fixed-interval behavior but need lifecycle/type expansion for the full requirement.
- Current `audio_assets` matches the content/audio manifest direction and should be reused or generalized.
- Current `sync_outbox` can continue for privacy-safe event syncing.

## Behavior and Edge Cases

### Daily Study Block

Preconditions:

- Learner profile exists.
- At least one content package with active lessons is installed.
- SRS/mastery state is initialized.

Happy path:

1. Learner opens Today.
2. App asks time/speaking availability and mode.
3. Adaptation engine reads due reviews, weak skills, prerequisites, recent errors, speaking gap, and next lesson.
4. App builds a 5-minute, normal, or deep-practice block.
5. Learner completes mixed review and lesson activities.
6. App records attempts, updates SRS/mastery/errors, stores recordings, and shows concise feedback.

Failure/alternate paths:

- No content package installed: show download/import prompt.
- Review backlog is greater than 20 due items or estimated above 10 minutes: skip or reduce new content and build a consolidation block.
- No microphone permission: allow listening/recognition activities and mark speaking activity blocked by permission.
- Audio asset missing: show retry/download fallback and do not mark listening/speaking objective passed.
- App killed mid-lesson: resume from last persisted activity state where feasible, otherwise preserve completed attempts and rebuild block.

### Lesson Pass Handling

- `pass`: learner meets exit check and final speaking/listening task requirements.
- `conditional_pass`: learner can continue, but specific review/remediation items are scheduled.
- `not_yet`: learner receives a 3-7 minute recovery path or 3-5 recovery lessons depending on severity; stage is not reset.

### Content Import

1. Fetch manifest.
2. Download hybrid ZIP package and referenced assets.
3. Verify checksum and schema.
4. Validate stable IDs, prerequisites, answer keys, asset references, and item limits.
5. Import in transaction.
6. Activate new content version only after successful import.
7. Keep previous version active if any step fails.

## Risks and Mitigations

| ID | Cause -> Event -> Impact | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-1 | Content is the bottleneck -> lessons are incomplete or inconsistent -> MVP cannot validate learning outcome | High | High | Build one full "Daily stand-up" lesson first, create content lint, then scale to 15-20 lessons. |
| RISK-2 | Existing review model is vocabulary-specific -> adding chunks/patterns/errors becomes tangled -> implementation slows and bugs increase | Medium | High | Introduce a generalized review item domain before adding speaking/error SRS. |
| RISK-3 | Speaking assessment overclaims accuracy -> learner trust/legal risk | Medium | High | Keep MVP feedback to self-check, task completion, phrase use, response time, and optional STT hints. |
| RISK-4 | Offline package import fails partially -> learner loses access or progress links | Medium | High | Use transaction, checksum, rollback, old-version retention, and import tests. |
| RISK-5 | Review backlog becomes overwhelming -> learner stops using app | High | Medium | Enforce backlog rules and new-item caps from the adaptation engine. |
| RISK-6 | Product scope expands to chatbot/CMS/full curriculum too early -> MVP never ships | Medium | High | Lock MVP to 8 priority units, 15-20 complete lessons, rule-based behavior. |
| RISK-7 | Stable content IDs are not governed -> progress/SRS breaks after updates | Medium | High | Require content ID linting and version migration tests before package activation. |

## Complexity Estimate

No sufficiently supported historical estimate is available in the inspected context. The repository contains previous plans and implemented slices, but there is no comparable historical dataset with normalized units, similar scope, quality, and completion metrics.

Qualitative complexity: High.

Drivers:

- New content/course domain and import/versioning.
- Generalized SRS/mastery beyond existing vocabulary flashcards.
- Lesson runtime with multiple activity types.
- Audio/recording permission and file lifecycle.
- Rule-based adaptation and remediation.
- Content production and content QA, which is outside pure coding.

Smallest useful first milestone: define content schema and implement one complete "Daily stand-up" lesson vertical slice from package import through lesson runtime, speaking/recording, SRS update, error capture, and Today scheduling.

## MVP Milestones

| Milestone | Goal | Exit Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| M1 Content Contract | Define hybrid ZIP package schema, stable IDs, validators, and one complete Daily stand-up lesson package. | Content lint passes for one Daily stand-up lesson with audio references and SRS/remediation declarations. |
| M2 Package Import | Install/activate content package offline with rollback. | Corrupt checksum/schema fails safely; previous active package remains usable. |
| M3 Runtime Slice | Render one lesson end to end with declared activities. | Learner can complete context, guided practice, shadowing, recall, role-play, exit check. |
| M4 Generalized SRS | Support review items for chunks, patterns, Q&A, dialogue turns, and errors. | Fixed-interval scheduling and lifecycle transitions pass unit tests. |
| M5 Speaking and Error Notebook | Add recording/playback, self-check, error capture, remediation. | Recording metadata persists; failures schedule correct recovery. |
| M6 Today and Adaptation | Build Today block generation and explainable rules. | Backlog/weak-skill/prerequisite/speaking-gap rules produce testable decisions. |
| M7 MVP Content Expansion | Produce 15-20 lessons across 8 priority units. | Content lint and scenario QA pass; weekly/stage checks available. |
| M8 Pilot Readiness | Run self-dogfood plus a 3-5 learner pilot for at least 7 days. | Success metrics can be collected without manual database inspection. |

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Reason | Invalidated When | Affected Items |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-5 | Content authoring and audio production can be handled outside app code, with import/lint tooling in scope. | Product depends on curated lessons. | No content production capacity exists. | MVP milestones and readiness. |

## Approved Decisions

| ID | Decision | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-1 | Use current `mobile-app` as the implementation base; do not use `mobile-app-sete89`, `mobile-app-sete90`, or `mobile-app-sete93`. | Approved | Fixes the source tree for future planning. |
| DEC-2 | Use hybrid ZIP content packages: `manifest.json`, lesson JSON, audio/assets, and checksums. | Approved | Fixes importer, tooling, and package validation direction. |
| DEC-3 | Use "Daily stand-up" as the first vertical-slice lesson. | Approved | Fixes the first end-to-end proof target. |
| DEC-4 | Include OS speech-to-text only as optional support where available; do not use it as pass/fail. | Approved | Fixes speaking feedback scope and permission handling. |
| DEC-5 | Hide scan/paste/OCR/AI lesson generation from the English Full-stack MVP path and keep it behind release flags. | Approved | Keeps MVP focused on curated offline learning. |
| DEC-6 | Treat due review greater than 20 items or estimated review time greater than 10 minutes as high backlog and switch/reduce toward consolidation. | Approved | Fixes rule-engine threshold. |
| DEC-7 | Provide slow and natural audio per MVP sentence/dialogue, compressed and checksum-verified; multiple voices are not required. | Approved | Fixes MVP audio expectation while leaving codec/bitrate to implementation. |
| DEC-8 | Run pilot with 3-5 Vietnamese low-confidence/beginner English learners for at least 7 days, after self-dogfood. | Approved | Fixes MVP validation sample and minimum duration. |

## Open Questions

No blocking product decisions remain for an implementation plan. Future implementation may still choose lower-level details such as exact audio codec/bitrate, ZIP internal folder names, and SQLite table names, provided the approved decisions and verification criteria remain satisfied.

## Decisions Required Before Implementation Planning

None. Owner has approved the recommended defaults. However, implementation planning is intentionally not started per owner instruction: "chưa chuyển sang implement vội".

## Traceability Summary

| Outcome | Key Requirements | Verification Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| OUT-1 | REQ-12 to REQ-19 | VC-1, VC-4, VC-16 |
| OUT-2 | REQ-5 to REQ-11 | VC-2, VC-3, VC-15 |
| OUT-3 | REQ-24 to REQ-29 | VC-5, VC-6, VC-18 |
| OUT-4 | REQ-20 to REQ-23 | VC-7, VC-17 |
| OUT-5 | REQ-30 to REQ-33 | VC-8 |
| OUT-6 | REQ-34 to REQ-38, REQ-42 to REQ-45 | VC-9, VC-10, VC-21, VC-22, VC-23 |
| OUT-7 | REQ-7, REQ-8 | VC-11 |
| OUT-8 | REQ-39 to REQ-41 | VC-12, VC-19, VC-20 |

## Readiness Summary

Stable:

- Target learner and product promise.
- Offline-first mobile direction.
- MVP vertical-slice scope.
- Rule-based adaptation principle.
- Speaking practice without accent-scoring claims.
- Need for versioned content packages and stable IDs.

Can proceed later under approved decisions:

- Implementation planning for schema/content package/importer.
- First Daily stand-up vertical slice.
- Generalized review item model.
- Today block builder and rule-engine tests.

Not started by request:

- Implementation plan for M1-M3.
- Product code changes.
- Content package scaffolding.

Recommended next step when owner resumes implementation planning: create an implementation plan for Milestone M1-M3 around one complete "Daily stand-up" lesson. Do not expand to 15-20 lessons until the schema, importer, runtime, SRS update, speaking recording, and remediation path work end to end for that first lesson.
