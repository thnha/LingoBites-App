# Cost Estimate — LingoBites

## 1. Purpose

This document is separated from BA to track app operating costs. Figures are estimates for Phase 0 based on current architecture:

```text
Mobile app → Backend proxy → OCR provider / AI provider → Local saved lesson
```

Principles: Phase 0 local-first, no mandatory login, no cloud sync, no original image storage by default.

Quick reference:

| Key point | Value |
|---|---:|
| Paste text lesson | ~0.003–0.008 USD / lesson |
| Image → OCR → AI lesson | ~0.005–0.015 USD / lesson |
| Small closed beta | ~30–100 USD/month after store account fees |
| Most important guardrails | 3,000 characters, max 1 AI retry, no AI call when opening saved lesson |

## 2. Fixed costs

| Item | Required? | Estimate | Period | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Apple Developer Program | If publishing iOS/TestFlight broadly | 99 USD | Annual | Needed for App Store/TestFlight production workflow |
| Google Play Console | If publishing Android on Play Store | 25 USD | One-time | Developer account registration fee |
| Domain | Recommended | 10–20 USD | Annual | For API/support/privacy URL |
| Small backend hosting | When using real OCR/AI | 5–25 USD | Monthly | Railway/Render/Fly/small VPS |
| Support email | Recommended before beta | 0–10 USD | Monthly | Gmail/domain email acceptable initially |
| Crash reporting | Recommended | 0 USD initially | Monthly | Firebase Crashlytics usually sufficient for small beta |
| Product analytics | Recommended | 0 USD initially | Monthly | PostHog/Firebase free tier sufficient if events are few |
| Monitoring/logging | Recommended | 0–20 USD | Monthly | Start with hosting logs; increase with traffic |

### Minimum fixed total

| Level | Cost |
|---|---:|
| Internal/local only, not on store yet | 5–25 USD/month |
| Closed beta iOS + Android first year | 124 USD upfront + 5–35 USD/month |
| Minimum public beta | 124 USD upfront + 30–100 USD/month |

## 3. Variable cost per lesson

Assume 1 lesson includes:

- 1 OCR call if user uses image.
- 1 AI analysis.
- No AI call when opening saved lesson.
- Free users may use BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) to pay AI provider directly.
- Paid users use system managed AI key, no personal token required.

| Component | When incurred | Estimate / call | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| OCR text detection | User captures/uploads image | ~0.0015 USD after free tier | Google Cloud Vision Text Detection often free for first 1,000 requests/month |
| AI analysis | Each lesson generation | ~0.003–0.008 USD | Depends on model, input/output length, retry |
| AI retry invalid output | When schema invalid | +0–100% of that request's AI cost | Spec limits retry to at most 1 |
| Backend bandwidth | Image upload/API response | Very small initially | May increase with large images or high traffic |
| Logging/analytics event | Each funnel step | Near zero initially | Avoid sending raw text/AI output |

### Quick estimates

| Lesson type | Variable cost / lesson |
|---|---:|
| Paste text, no OCR | ~0.003–0.008 USD |
| Image → OCR → AI | ~0.005–0.015 USD |
| Image + multiple AI retries | ~0.010–0.025 USD |

## 4. Impact of BYOK / paid managed mode

BYOK reduces system AI cost because users pay the provider directly. Paid managed AI is better for mainstream UX but the system bears usage cost, so quota/rate limits are required.

For security design and setup details see `docs/01-ba/08-operations/03-ai-key-strategy-byok-paid-managed.md`.

## 5. Cost scenarios by traffic

| Scenario | Lessons/month | AI + OCR | Backend/monitoring | Total ops/month |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Internal test | 500 | 0–5 USD | 5–10 USD | 5–15 USD |
| Small closed beta | 5,000 | 25–75 USD | 5–25 USD | 30–100 USD |
| Medium beta | 50,000 | 250–750 USD | 25–100 USD | 275–850 USD |
| Small scale | 100,000 | 500–1,500 USD | 50–200 USD | 550–1,700 USD |

> Quick formula: `monthly_cost ≈ fixed_infra + lessons * cost_per_lesson`.
>
> For image lessons, use `cost_per_lesson = 0.005–0.015 USD`.

## 6. One-time / irregular costs

| Item | Estimate | When needed |
|---|---:|---|
| App icon / store screenshots | 0–300 USD | Before public beta or polished store listing |
| Privacy policy/legal review | 0–500+ USD | Before public beta, especially since app sends image/text to providers |
| Real device QA | 0–1,000+ USD | If no iPhone/Android test devices available |
| Provider evaluation | 0–100 USD | When testing multiple OCR/AI models |
| BYOK setup/security review | Primarily time | When allowing users to enter their own API key |
| Build/release signing setup | Primarily time | Before TestFlight/Play Store |
| Support/CS time | Primarily time | When real beta users exist |

## 7. Phase 0 cost guardrails

| Guardrail | Suggested value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Max text length | 3,000 characters | Prevent token cost spikes |
| Max image size | 5 MB before backend reject | Avoid OCR/bandwidth increase |
| AI retry | At most 1 on invalid output | Limit retry cost |
| OCR retry | User-triggered, no auto loop | Prevent infinite loops |
| Daily request cap | 20–50 lessons/user/day for beta | Prevent abuse |
| Monthly budget alert | 20 USD, 50 USD, 100 USD during closed beta | Detect cost spikes |
| Saved lesson reopen | Do not call AI again | Reduce cost and keep UX stable |
| Log sensitive content | Off by default | Reduce privacy risk |
| Analytics payload | No raw text, no images, no full AI output | Keep events small and safe |
| Paid managed quota | Limit lessons/day or credits/month per plan | Protect margin |
