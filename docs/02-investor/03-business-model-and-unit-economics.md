# Business Model & Unit Economics

## 1. Business model hypothesis

LingoBites can start with a hybrid model:

```text
Free/BYOK for cost control
Paid managed AI for convenience
Future premium learning features for retention
```

This matches the product reality: AI/OCR creates direct usage cost, so pricing must control cost per generated lesson.

## 2. Pricing tiers

| Tier | Target user | AI setup | Revenue logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free demo | Curious user | Mock/sample or small quota | Acquisition |
| Free BYOK | Power user / technical user | User provides own API key | Near-zero AI cost to system |
| Paid managed | Main paid segment | System AI key | User pays for convenience |
| Future premium | Retained learners | System AI + review features | Subscription / bundles |

Recommended early positioning:

```text
Free users can bring their own AI key. Paid users do not need to configure anything.
```

## 3. Cost per lesson

| Lesson type | Estimated variable cost |
|---|---:|
| Paste text only | ~0.003-0.008 USD |
| Image → OCR → AI | ~0.005-0.015 USD |
| Image + AI retry | ~0.010-0.025 USD |

Key cost drivers:

- AI output tokens
- OCR request count
- retry rate
- long input text
- user abuse/spam

## 4. BYOK effect

| Scenario | BYOK ratio | System pays AI for | AI cost impact |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Free-only BYOK | 100% | 0% of free lessons | AI cost near zero |
| Power-user beta | 70% | 30% of lessons | Large cost reduction |
| Mixed beta | 40% | 60% of lessons | Moderate cost reduction |
| Paid-first | 0-10% | Most lessons | Higher cost, better UX |

BYOK is not the best mass-market UX, but it is useful for:

- early adopters
- beta testing
- cost control
- transparent free tier

Paid managed AI remains important for mainstream users.

## 5. Cost guardrails

| Guardrail | Default |
|---|---|
| Max text length | 3.000 characters |
| Max image size | 5 MB |
| AI retry | Max 1 retry |
| Saved lesson reopen | No AI call |
| Trial quota | 5-10 lessons/user |
| Paid daily cap | 50-200 lessons/user/day depending plan |
| Budget alerts | 20, 50, 100 USD during closed beta |

---

## 6. Early revenue hypotheses

These are hypotheses to validate, not confirmed pricing:

| Model | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly subscription | Simple, predictable | Needs retention features |
| Credit bundle | Maps to AI cost | More complex UX |
| Freemium + BYOK | Low system cost | Technical setup can confuse beginners |
| Paid convenience | Strong user logic: no API key needed | Requires cost cap and quota |

Recommended validation:

1. Start with free/trial + BYOK during beta.
2. Measure generated lessons, save rate, return rate.
3. Test willingness to pay for managed AI.
4. Add subscription only after retention loop improves.

## 7. What investors should watch

| Metric | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Cost per generated lesson | Determines gross margin |
| Save rate | Indicates lesson value |
| Review/open saved lesson rate | Indicates retention potential |
| D1/D7 retention | Indicates habit formation |
| AI schema valid rate | Determines reliability |
| OCR success rate | Determines scan UX quality |
| Paid conversion / paid intent | Determines monetization path |
