# Risk & Mitigation

## 1. Product risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Users only want translation, not lesson | Weak learning retention | Test save/review rate and qualitative feedback |
| Lesson output is too long | Beginners feel overwhelmed | Limit vocabulary/grammar count, beginner-first copy |
| OCR mistakes damage lesson | Bad trust | OCR review/edit before AI |
| AI explanations are inconsistent | Poor reliability | Canonical schema, validation, retry, sample eval |

## 2. Cost risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AI cost grows with usage | Bad margins | Text limit, quota, BYOK, no AI recall for saved lessons |
| Users spam generate | Cost spike | Rate limit, request cap, anomaly alerts |
| Retry rate high | Cost and latency increase | Better prompt/schema, provider eval |
| OCR provider cost grows | Higher image lesson cost | Free tier, compression, provider benchmarking |

## 3. Privacy and trust risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| User uploads sensitive text/image | Privacy concern | Clear privacy note, avoid storing original images |
| API key leakage in BYOK | Severe trust issue | Secure storage, no logs, masked display |
| Provider data handling unclear | Legal/store risk | Privacy policy disclosure and provider review |
| Logging raw content | Compliance/trust issue | Log metadata only |

## 4. Market risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Existing tools add similar feature | Competition | Focus on Vietnamese beginner UX and retention loop |
| Low willingness to pay | Weak monetization | Validate paid managed convenience and premium review features |
| BYOK too hard for users | Free tier friction | Keep BYOK optional; paid user needs no token |
| Acquisition channels weak | Slow growth | Test Facebook/TikTok/community/teacher channels early |

## 5. Technical risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile native complexity | Slow delivery | React Native CLI, add camera/gallery in M3 |
| Backend key management | Security burden | Backend proxy, env/secret manager, no mobile system key |
| Saved lesson data drift | Bad review UX | Store full validated `ai_output_json` |
| Schema changes break UI | Regression | Version schema and fixtures |
