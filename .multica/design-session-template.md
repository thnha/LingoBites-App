# Design Session: [Feature Name]

## Lane Selection

**Lane:** [Full / Fast]

**Rationale:** [Explain why this lane was chosen based on criteria: number of screens, shared components, theme changes, data sensitivity, or TranHoangNha request]

## Stage Plan

### Full Lane (9 stages, 3 gates)
| Stage | Work | Assignee | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Design brief, scope, screen inventory, clarification log, traceability register | Design Lead | todo |
| 2 | **Human Gate 1** — user flow approval | TranHoangNha | backlog |
| 3 | IA, task/user/screen flows, states, exception/recovery paths | UX Flow & IA Designer | backlog |
| 4a | Wireframe + state matrix + responsive | UI & Wireframe Designer | backlog |
| 4b | Content copy deck + error matrix | Content Designer | backlog |
| 5 | **Human Gate 2** — wireframe business/usability approval | TranHoangNha | backlog |
| 6 | UI spec, design-system gap list, HTML handoff, motion spec | UI & Wireframe Designer | backlog |
| 7 | Heuristic review, contrast check, a11y checklist, issue log | UX & Accessibility Critic | backlog |
| 8 | Synthesis: final handoff package, traceability matrix, logs | Design Lead | backlog |
| 9 | **Human Gate 3** — final handoff approval | TranHoangNha | backlog |

### Fast Lane (5 stages, 1 gate)
| Stage | Work | Assignee | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Brief + flow | Design Lead | todo |
| 2 | Wireframe + UI spec + HTML handoff | UI & Wireframe Designer | backlog |
| 3 | Heuristic + accessibility review | UX & Accessibility Critic | backlog |
| 4 | Synthesize final package | Design Lead | backlog |
| 5 | **Human Gate 3** (only 1 gate) | TranHoangNha | backlog |

- [ ] Traceability matrix
- [ ] Final synthesis document

## Completion Checklist

Per Design Team Completion Rule:

- [ ] User flow passed Human Gate 1
- [ ] Wireframes passed Human Gate 2
- [ ] Every critical requirement and state represented in design or documented as non-visual
- [ ] No critical usability/accessibility/traceability issues remain unresolved
- [ ] All open risks and questions have owners
- [ ] Final handoff package passed Human Gate 3

**Instructions for Design Lead:**
1. Fill in lane selection and rationale
2. Create sub-issues for each stage according to the selected lane
3. Stage 1 sub-issue is `todo`, all others start as `backlog`
4. Human gate sub-issues use `--status in_review`
5. Promote next stage from `backlog` to `todo` only after current stage completes
6. Update this parent issue's logs throughout the session
7. Self-close stage sub-issues to `done` after submitting work (only gates use `in_review`)
